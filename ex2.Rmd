```

## Exercise 2

### Create a sample with 100 values from a log-normal distribution:

```{r sample}
x <- rlnorm(100,1,0.25)

x
```




### Create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log-scale:

```{r histogram}
hist(x, 20, main='Histogram of a sample of a lognormal distribution', col = "lightblue", border = "pink")

hist(log(x), 20, main='Histogram of a sample of a lognormal distribution on the log-scale', col = "lightblue", border = "pink")

mu = mean(x)
var = var(x)
```


### Report the mean and variance of the sample in line in the text:

Mu is `r toString(mu)` and the variance is `r toString(var)`.
